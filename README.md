# Logistic-map-bifurcation-diagram
A program to plot the bifurcation diagram for a modified logisitic map

The equation for the modified version of the logisitic map is shown below:

This system has two control parameters: a and b, unlike the original logistic map which has just a single control parameter a. 

The program can be run for different values of b which can be done by setting it within the code itself.
